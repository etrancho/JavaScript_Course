For this assignment, I created a program that turns array elements into a sentence. I created a function that takes an array of words, as an argument. My function loops through the array and adds each element into an empty string. The function returns a sentence as its final output. 
To make this program, I used my programming skills to create an array, declare a function, and use a for loop.
