<p>In the first part of the assignment, I was able to create a PacMan and make it move across the screen. 
In this assigment, I took a step further: I created a PacMan on demand (button click) and move these PacMen across the page.</p>

<p>Here's how the game is played:</p>

* When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new PacMan appears at a random position on the screen.
* When you click the "Start Game" button, the PacMan or PacMen created starts moving at random velocity on the screen.
* When a given Pacman hits the edge of the screen, it changes position to stay within the frame of the web page.
