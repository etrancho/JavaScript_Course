In the first part of the assignment, you were able to create a PacMan and make it move across the screen. In this activity, we're going to take that a step further. 

Your task in this activity is to create a PacMan on demand (button click) and move these PacMen across the page

Here's how the game is played:

When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new PacMan should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the PacMan or PacMen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given Pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
The starter code includes comments to guide you through this activity.
