For my first project, I worked on part 1 of the PacMan exercise. My task was to simulate the PacMan moving across the screen and reversing direction when it reaches the edge of the page. 

Through this exercise, I learned how to control the DOM. The DOM holds data such as HTML objects or elements of a webpage.
