<p>For this assignment, I created a fortune teller game. The program allows the user to pick a number between 0 to 10. Then, the program reads the number and output a fortune.</p>

* If the number is between 0 and 3, then they have a low fortune.
* If the number is between 4 and 7, then they have an average fortune.
* If the number is between 8 and 10, then they have a great fortune.

<p>Otherwise, any other fortune should not be read by the program. To set up the game, youâ€™ll use your programming skills to declare variables, use comparison operators, and create conditional statements.</p>
