<p>For this assignment, I created a short story in VS Code. I created variables to represent different elements of the story. The program includes the following basic data type variables: 1 array, 1 boolean, 3 integers, and 4 strings. Also, I added more details to my story, by creating more variables as I developed the program.</p> 

<p>Once I had completed my program, I copied and pasted my code to JavaScript Tutor (https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) to see how the variables are being stored in memory.</p>
