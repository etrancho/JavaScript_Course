# JavaScript_Course
For this assignment, I worked on building my GitHub repository. My repository includes projects and assignments completed in the JavaScript course. 
This will allow me to showcase my JavaScript skills. 

To complete this assignment, I added new files, commit, and push the changes to GitHub from the VS Code environment, just as I did during the class lesson. 

My profile should feature the following assignments and projects:
* Fortune Teller Assignment
* Creating Sentences Assignment
* JavaScript Tutor: Working with Basic Data Types
* Debugging Assignment
* Unit Testing Activity
* Project Pt 1: PacMan Assignment
* Project Pt 2: PacMen Factory Assignment
