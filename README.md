<p>For this assignment, I worked on building my GitHub repository. My repository includes projects and assignments completed in the JavaScript course. 
This will allow me to showcase my JavaScript skills.</p> 

<p>To complete this assignment, I added new files, commit, and push the changes to GitHub from the VS Code environment, just as I did during the class lesson.</p>  

<p>My profile features the following assignments and projects:</p> 

* Fortune Teller Assignment
